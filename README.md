As I totally didn't have anything to do lately, I decided to release this UI, so here's what I was able to design in a two hours, something like that. You may feel free to modify this project by editing it.
(buttons for execute, inject i made fast than other things so that's why they are poorly developed)

This Interface Including:
- WebView Monaco Editor
- TabControl
- Script List 
- Using FluxAPI
- Some Animations
